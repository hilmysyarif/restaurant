# Restaurant website

## About the website
This is a responsive website I made for a Cafe based on a self created brief. This website was built to be a Single page application using the React front-end framework and AJAX to communicate to the Laravel back-end API. This website features all the basic functionality for a typical restaurant website while having a simple back-end for easy editing of content.

## Technical details

Front-end code for the website is located in the resources/app/jsx folder and the resources/admin-app/jsx folder.

SASS code is located in the resources/assets folder.

The laravel back-end is primarily used as an API for the front-end code. It is primarily located in the app, app/http and database folder
